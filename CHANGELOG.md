# Bug Fix
- Fixes the bug where if you set options for a request it overrides the instance options by cloning the objects
- Can't clone a set for some reason so plugins is now an array and this allows duplicates but in my opinion this could be useful sometimes like run a plugin multiple times

# 0.0.1 (Development release)
- Initial Release
- Could be unstable
- Version won't be incremented until a stable npm release
